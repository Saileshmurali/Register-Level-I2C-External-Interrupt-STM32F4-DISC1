# Register-Level-I2C-External-Interrupt-STM32F4-DISC1
This repository contains code for interfacing MPU6050 with STM32F407 Discovery board with external interrupts. 
Pin PB6 corresponds to SCL, PB7 corresponds to SDA and PA0 is the pin for external interrupt(should be connected with INT pin of the accelerometer). The code samples acceleration values at 1KHz.
